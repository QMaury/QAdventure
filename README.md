# QAdventure
text based adventure game written in C

`> You are on a quest to kill a ghoul.`

Redundant, pointless, and programmed without a single ounce of talent, but it works kind of.

good game for 30 seconds of amusement (definitely worth the 15 seconds it'll take you to clone and then compile)

if you think i'm a dumb stooge and my code sucks, send a pull request, bitch!
